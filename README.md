# Computer Science PoliTO 2016 (English course) - Exercises and lectures

In this GitHub repo I will upload all the exercises and lectures for the Computer Science class of PoliTO year 2016

NOTE: Some exercises might be wrong, incomplete or slightly different from the Labs you might find in your CS class, so if you feel like something is wrong you may send a PR to keep this repository updated, I won't personally recheck these exercises since I already passed the class.
